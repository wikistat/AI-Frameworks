## Practical session

For this session, you will have to write a script to train a small neural network on the MNIST dataset using Pytorch.  
During training, you will use tensorboard to:

- monitor your network across epochs
- manage your experiments and hyper-parameters  
- provide some visualizations.

The solution is available here.  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidBert/N7-techno-IA/blob/master/code/developpement/MNIST_solution.ipynb)

## The network class:

![](img/Mnist_net.png)

Using the figure above, fill in the following code, in the ``mnist_net.py`` file, to create the network class:  

* The method ``__init__()`` should instantiate all the layers that will be used  by the network.
* The method ``forward()`` describes the forward graph of your network. All the pooling operations and activation functions are realized in this method. Do not forget to change the shape of your input before the first linear layer using ``torch.flatten(...)`` or ``x.view(...)``.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MNISTNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MNNISTNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(...)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(...)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(...)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(...)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(...)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(...)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))       # First convolution followed by
        x = self.pool(x)                # a relu activation and a max pooling#
        x = ...
        ...
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```
## The training script
The previous file contained our model class. We will now complete the training script ``train_mnist.py``.
This file will be used as a python script to train a neural network on the MNIST Dataset.  
The ``train()`` and ``test()`` methods are already implemented.

```python
import argparse
from statistics import mean

import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
from tqdm import tqdm

from models import MNISTNet

 # setting device on GPU if available, else CPU
  device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

def train(net, optimizer, loader, epochs=10):
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        running_loss = []
        t = tqdm(loader)
        for x, y in t:
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
            outputs = net(x)
            loss = criterion(outputs, y)
            running_loss.append(loss.item())
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            t.set_description(f'training loss: {mean(running_loss)}')

def test(model, dataloader):
    test_corrects = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for x, y in dataloader:
            x = x.to(device)
            y = y.to(device)
            y_hat = model(x).argmax(1)
            test_corrects += y_hat.eq(y).sum().item()
            total += y.size(0)
    return test_corrects / total
```
We will now implement the ``main`` method that will be called every time the python script is executed.  
We would like to give the user the possibility to adjust some parameters of the learning process, such as:

* The batch size
* The learning rate
* The number of training epochs

To do so we will use Python [argparse module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html). This module is used to write user-friendly command-line interfaces.  
Adding an argument to a python script using __argaparse__ is pretty straightforward.  
First you need to import the argparse module and instanciate a parser within the ``main`` method:

```python
import argparse

if __name__=='__main__':
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
```

Then, just add a new argument to the parser precising the argument's name, its type, and optionaly a default value and an helping message.

```python
  parser.add_argument('--exp_name', type=str, default = 'MNIST', help='experiment name')
```

Finaly, you can use the arguments in the script by using an ``args`` variable.

```python
  args = parser.parse_args()
  print(args.exp_name)
```

Complete the main method to parse the four possible arguments provided when executing the script:


```python
if __name__=='__main__':

  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
  
  parser.add_argument('--exp_name', type=str, default = 'MNIST', help='experiment name')
  parser.add_argument(...)
  parser.add_argument(...)
  parser.add_argument(...)

  args = parser.parse_args()
  exp_name = args.exp_name
  epochs = ...
  batch_size = ...
  lr = ...
```

The following code instantiates two [data loaders](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html): one loading data from the training set, the other one from the test set.

```python
# transforms
  transform = transforms.Compose(
      [transforms.ToTensor(),
      transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])

  # datasets
  trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('./data', download=True, train=True, transform=transform)
  testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('./data', download=True, train=False, transform=transform)

  # dataloaders
  trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
  testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
```

Instantiate a MNISTNet and a [SGD optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html) using the learning rate provided in the script arguments and use the train method to train your network and the test method to compute the test accuracy. 

```python
  net = ...
  # setting net on device(GPU if available, else CPU)
  net = net.to(device)
  optimizer = optim.SGD(...)

  train(...)
  test_acc = test(...)
  print(f'Test accuracy:{test_acc}')
```

Finally, save your model using the ``torch.save`` method.

```python
  torch.save(net.state_dict(), 'mnist_net.pth')
```

You should now be able to run your python script using the following command in your terminal:
```
python train_mnist.py --epochs=5 --lr=1e-3 --batch_size=64
```

## Monitoring and experiment management
Training our model on MNIST is pretty fast.
Nonetheless, in most cases, training a network may be very long.
For such cases, it is essential to log partial results during training to ensure that everything is behaving as expected.  
A very famous tool to monitor your experiments in deep learning is Tensorboard.  
The main object used by Tensorboard is a ``SummaryWriter``.  
Add the following import:
```python
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
```
and modify the train method to take an additional argument named ``writer``. Use its ``add_scalar`` method to log the training loss for every epoch.

```python
def train(net, optimizer, loader, writer, epochs=10):
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        running_loss = []
        t = tqdm(loader)
        for x, y in t:
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
            outputs = net(x)
            loss = criterion(outputs, y)
            running_loss.append(loss.item())
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            t.set_description(f'training loss: {mean(running_loss)}')
        writer.add_scalar('training loss', mean(running_loss), epoch)
```
In the ```main``` method instantiate a ``SummaryWriter`` with 
```python
writer = SummaryWriter(f'runs/MNIST')
```
and add it as argument to the ``train`` method.  
Re-run your script and check your tensorboard logs using in a separate terminal:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs
```

You can use tensorboard to log many different things such as your network computational graph, images, samples from your dataset, embeddings, or even use it for experiment management.  

Add a new method to the MNISTNet class to get the embeddings computed after the last convolutional layer.

```python
def get_features(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 4 * 4)
        return x
```

Now these following code to the end of your ```main``` function to log the embeddings and the computational graph in tensorboard. 

```python
  #add embeddings to tensorboard
  perm = torch.randperm(len(trainset.data))
  images, labels = trainset.data[perm][:256], trainset.targets[perm][:256]
  images = images.unsqueeze(1).float().to(device)
  with torch.no_grad():
    embeddings = net.get_features(images)
    writer.add_embedding(embeddings,
                  metadata=labels,
                  label_img=images, global_step=1)
    
  # save networks computational graph in tensorboard
  writer.add_graph(net, images)
  # save a dataset sample in tensorboard
  img_grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images[:64])
  writer.add_image('mnist_images', img_grid)
```

Re-run your script and restart tensorboard.   
Visualize the network computational graph by clicking on __Graph__.  
You should see something similar to this:
![](img/tensorboard_2.png)

Click on the __inactive__ button and choose __projector__ to look at the embeddings computed by your network

## Deploying your model with Gradio

We will now create a simple application to guess the numbers drawn by a user from our saved model.  
We will use the [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) library to quickly prototype machine learning applications and demonstrations with user friendly web interfaces.

Install the library:
```bash
pip install gradio
```

Creating an application with Gradio is done through the use of its Interface class
The core Interface class is initialized with three required parameters:

* fn: the function to wrap a user interface around
* inputs: which component(s) to use for the input, e.g. "text" or "image" or "audio"
* outputs: which component(s) to use for the output, e.g. "text" or "image" "label"

Gradio includes more than [20 different components](https://gradio.app/docs/#components), most of which can be used as inputs or outputs.

In this example, we will use a *sketchpad* (which is an instance of the [*Image* component](https://gradio.app/docs/#image))component for the input and a [*Label* component](https://gradio.app/docs/#label)  for the output.

```python
gr.Interface(fn=recognize_digit, 
            inputs="sketchpad", 
            outputs=gr.outputs.Label(num_top_classes=3),
            live=True,
            description="Draw a number on the sketchpad to see the model's prediction.",
            ).launch(debug=True, share=True);
```

Complete the ```mnist_app.py``` file so that the weights path is provided by the user and run your application with the following command:
```bash
python mnist_app.py --weights_path [path_to_the weights]
```

Is your model accurate with your drawings?
Do you know why it is less accurate than on MNIST?

## Git
Commit all the modifications you have made to the repository as well as the weights and push them to your remote repository.
