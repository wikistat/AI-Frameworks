# Evaluation

The evaluation is associated to the [DEFI-IA](https://defi-ia.insa-toulouse.fr/)

### Objective
    
You will be evaluated on your capacity of acting like a ***Data Scientist***, i.e. 

* Handle a new dataset and explore it.
* Find a solution to address the defi's problem with a high score (above baseline).
* Explain the choosen algorithm.
* Write a complete pipeline to easily reproduce the results.
* Justify the choice of the algorithms and the environment (CPU/GPU, Cloud etc..).
* Share it and make your results easily reproducible (Git -  docker, conda environment.).

### Notations

1. Project - (**60%**): a Git repository.
    * The git should contain a clear markdown Readme, which describes  (**33%**)
        * Which result you achieved? In which computation time? On which engine?
        * What do I have to install to be able to reproduce the code? 
        * Which command do I have to run to reproduce the results?
    * The code has to be easily reproducible.  (**33%**)
        * Packages required has to be well described.
         (a **requirements.txt** files is the best)
        * Conda command or docker command can be furnish 
    * The code should be clear and easily readable. (**33%**)
        * Final results can be run in a script and not a notebook.
        * Only final code can be found in this script. 
    <!-- * **Deadline** :  January 29 2021. -->
    
2. Rapport - (**40%**) 10 pages maximum:
    * Quality of the presentation. **25%**
    * In-Deep explanation of the chosen algorithm. **25%**
    * Choice of the tools-infrastructure used. **25%**
    * Results you obtained. **25%**
    <!-- * **Date** : January 29, 2021.  -->

### Other details

 * Group of 4 to 5 people (DEFI IA's team).
