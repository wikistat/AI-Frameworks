# Artificial Intelligence Frameworks

This course is the continuation of the [Machine Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/Apprentissage) and [High Dimensional & Deep Learning](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning) courses.  
While these courses focused on machine learning and deep learning theory and methods, this course aims to provide you with the tools to apply these methods in concrete situations.  

During this course you will:  

- Learn to use cloud computing to train your models efficiently
- Learn about code versioning and containers to share your code and produce reproducible results
-   Learn to process text data for natural language processing tasks
-   Learn to train autonomous agents to play video games using Reinforcement Learning


**NB**: Some contents from previous years are still available on the repository (like **Spark**) but are not treated anymore.
