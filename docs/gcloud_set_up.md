# Set up GCloud: 
Google sponsors this course with free GCloud credits through the Cloud Higher Education Programs.

Go to [this link](https://gcp.secure.force.com/GCPEDU?cid=HGfyYSrJnwOmvOkly5FUWbeGvTTyaYsuzI%2BUJ3owt3WKC%2BSJW%2BoIZzdGozvQAzWe/) to claim your coupon code for the credits associated with this course.  
Once you have your coupon code go to [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/education?authuser=4) to get your credits (you will need a Google account, if needed, you can create one using your INSA mail address).
Once you are on the GCloud homepage, start by creating a new project:  

![](img/gcloud/gcloud0.png)
![](img/gcloud/gcloud01.png)  
Once your project is created go to Compute Engine -> VM instances
![](img/gcloud/gcloud02.png)  
and activate Compute Engine API for your project ![](img/gcloud/gcloud03.png).  
You now need to add GPU capacity to your project.  
Go to IAM and admin -> Quotas  
![](img/gcloud/gcloud04.png).  
On the filter select Quota  
![](img/gcloud/gcloud05.png) and K80 GPUs(all regions)   
![](img/gcloud/gcloud06.png)  
and click on modify quotas  
![](img/gcloud/gcloud07.png).  
Increase the limit to one and add a short description to your request:

*Hi,*
*I am a student enrolled at INSA Toulouse.
The GCloud Higher education program granted us free credits.
These credits are associated with a course in which the practical sessions will require access to GPU machines.
Would you please increase my GPU quota so I can participate to the practical sessions?*

*Many thanks,*

*You name*

This process may take some time. Therefore, be sure sure to complete every steps at least a few days before the practical session.

You will also need to install the Cloud SDK Command-line interface.
It should already be installed on the INSA's machines.
If you are using your personal computer, follow the corresponding installation procedure available [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

Once the GCloud SDK is configured on your local machine, go to your GCloud interface and go to Compute engine ->VM instances  
![](img/gcloud/compute_engine.png)  

Click on the create new instance button ![](img/gcloud/create.png) to create your first instance.  
Be sure at this point that your quota request has been approved or you will not be able to attach a GPU to your Virtual Machine.  
Now create a new instance on the same region you asked for your GPU quota.
You may follow the following parameters settings for the practical session.
![](img/gcloud/new_instance.png)  
Select the following hard drive options  
![](img/gcloud/gcloud_disk.png)  
Finally, check the two checkboxes at the bottom of the page to allow Http/Https traffic.
![](img/gcloud/pare_feu.png)  
After a few minutes your instance should be created.
It should appear in the VM instance panel:
![](img/gcloud/instance_panel.png)  
If its status is in green, the virtual machine is started and consuming your free credit.
Go to ssh -> show ssh the gcloud command and copy the command on your terminal. ![](img/gcloud/command.png)  
You should now be connected to your virtual machine and see the following output on your terminal:
![](img/gcloud/terminal0.png)  
Type 'y' to install the nvidia drivers.
If the drivers failed to be installed and you obtain the following message:
![](img/gcloud/failed.png)
Wait a few minutes and type:
```console
cd /opt/deeplearning/
sudo ./install-driver.sh 
```
To verify that everything is correctly installed type the following command
```console
nvidia-smi
```
If you see something like 
```

```  
then your installation is complete and you can stop your virtual machine until the practical session using the GCloud web interface or typing the following command:

```console
sudo shutdown -h now
```

Be sur to do all this process before the practical session, it will save you many time and remenber at least to ask for your quotas as soon as possible!
